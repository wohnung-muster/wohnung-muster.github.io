<p><strong>Furnace System Diagram</strong>. The term HVAC stands for heating ventilation and air conditioning a system used to control the temperature in a space as well as humidity and quality of air. A gas forced-air heating system goes into action when the thermostat tells it that the room temperature has dropped below a preset comfort level. This Hvac For Beginners section begins here with a discussion about forced air duct systems the basics the how and why of duct sizing. In a big building the system needs to be able to function.</p>
